# Hand Gesture Detection (C++ with OpenCV)

This project explores multiple hand gesture recognition techniques:

- Skin color segmentation (HSV/YCrCb)
- Contour + Convex Hull analysis
- MediaPipe Hands (C++)
- Machine Learning with CNN/SVM

## How to Build

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./hand_gesture skin
